Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test or npm run test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nHere is the list of unit test write down for this app.\n  ButtonComponent\n    √ should create\n  SideNavComponent\n    √ should create\n  GiveConsentComponent\n    √ should disable button if aggrement is not selected\n    √ should enable button if aggrement is selected\n    √ should submit the form\n    √ should create\n    √ should enable button if all aggrements are selected\n    √ name should be required field\n    √ email should be valid\n  ListConsentsComponent\n    √ should change page\n    √ should get next page\n    √ should get pagination data\n    √ should get previous page\n    √ should create\n  AppComponent\n    √ should have as title 'Consent Management System'\n    √ should create the app\n  PaginationComponent\n    √ should disable prev button\n    √ should get first page\n    √ should get second page\n    √ should disable next button\n    √ should get last page\n    √ should change page\n    √ should get fourth page\n    √ should get next page\n    √ should create\n    √ should get total pages\n    √ should get prev page\n\nFinished in 1.415 secs / 1.109 secs @ 14:20:35 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)\n\nSUMMARY:\n√ 27 tests completed\n\n=============================== Coverage summary ===============================\nStatements   : 97.94% ( 143/146 )\nBranches     : 73.27% ( 85/116 )\nFunctions    : 93.75% ( 30/32 )\nLines        : 98.48% ( 130/132 )\n================================================================================\nRunning end-to-end tests (will add later on)\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\nCompodoc\nTo open Compodoc, use npm run compodoc.\nApplication Architecture\nStructure\nHere is
